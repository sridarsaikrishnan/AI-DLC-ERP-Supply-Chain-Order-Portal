    `instance_label` is operator-only and must never reach a reseller surface (FR-19).

    `webhook_secret_ref` is a SEPARATE Secrets Manager reference from `secret_ref`: the
    former is our credential for logging into the ERP, the latter is the credential the
    ERP uses to prove a webhook call came from it. Reusing one secret for both would mean
    a leaked webhook URL (which, for Odoo's shared-secret-in-path scheme, is the ERP admin
    UI's Automation Rule config — not a secret store) also leaks ERP login access. `None`
    until a connection's webhook is onboarded (target-architecture.md 5a: until then it
    silently relies on the reconciliation sweeper).

    `credentials` is a generic, adapter-interpreted bag of *non-secret* connection
    parameters — e.g. Odoo needs `{"database": ..., "username": ...}`; a token-auth ERP
    (NetSuite, ERPNext) might need an account id, or nothing at all here (everything in
    `secret_ref`). This replaced fixed `database`/`username` fields, which forced Odoo's
    login shape onto every future ERP regardless of whether it fit.
