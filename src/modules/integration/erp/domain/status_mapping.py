"""Native-ERP-status -> canonical-status mapping, as a registry (a PBT target).

To add a new ERP's status mapping: write one pure function `(fields: dict[str, str]) ->
CanonicalStatus | None` that reads whatever keys that ERP's status actually arrives in.
The signature doesn't force an arity — Odoo reads 2 keys (`state`, `invoice_status`), a
single-status-string ERP reads 1 (`status`), a hypothetical 3-field ERP reads 3. Add one
line to `STATUS_MAPPERS`. No other file changes. `map_native_status` itself never needs to
change again — this replaced an earlier version that hardcoded exactly 2 positional
string arguments, which was Odoo's shape leaking into what was meant to be ERP-neutral.
