"""ERP adapter registry — the one place a new ERP integration is wired in.

To add a new ERP:
  1. Implement `ErpAdapter` (`submit`/`fetch_status`/`cancel`) in a new
     `infrastructure/<erp>_adapter.py`, following `odoo_adapter.py`'s shape (stdlib-only
     HTTP, explicit timeouts, transient/terminal error classification).
  2. Register its native-status mapping in `domain/status_mapping.py` (`STATUS_MAPPERS`).
  3. Add one line to `build_adapter_registry` below.
  4. Add the ERP type to `ErpType` (`connections/domain/models.py`).
No other file needs to change — `composition.py` resolves adapters through this
registry regardless of how many ERP types are registered.
