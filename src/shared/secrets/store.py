"""Secret resolution behind a port.

A `secret_ref` stored on a connection (or a webhook signing key ref) is resolved to the
actual value here — never stored in plaintext in the DB (SECURITY-12). Local dev uses
env vars; production uses AWS Secrets Manager (`SecretsManagerSecretStore` in
`src/shared/secrets/aws.py` — kept in its own module so importing this port does not pull
in boto3, which keeps the domain modules framework-free, enforced by import-linter).

Every `secret_ref` up to now was provisioned externally (ops runs `aws secretsmanager
create-secret` by hand, then passes the ref in). Outbound webhook signing secrets are the
first case where the app itself generates the value (so it can show it to the reseller
exactly once), which is why `put_secret` exists — it's a real capability gap this closed,
not a speculative addition.
