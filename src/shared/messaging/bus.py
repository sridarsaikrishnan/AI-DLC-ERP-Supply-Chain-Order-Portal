"""In-memory message bus.

Models the production topology (SNS FIFO topic -> filtered SQS FIFO queues -> consumers,
with per-consumer dedup and redrive-to-DLQ) without any cloud dependency, so unit and
integration tests are deterministic. Production swaps in an SNS/SQS adapter behind the
same `EventPublisher` port + a `MessageConsumer` runner; the AWS adapter targets floci
locally and real AWS in prod using identical boto3 code.

Simplifications vs real SQS (documented on purpose):
- Delivery is driven explicitly via `run_until_empty()` (no background threads) for
  deterministic tests.
- Ordering is preserved by enqueue order per subscription (good enough to model
  MessageGroupId ordering for single-threaded drains).
- Redrive: a message that keeps failing is dead-lettered after `max_receive` attempts.
- Dedup: consumers skip an `event_id` they have already processed (models both the
  publish-side MessageDeduplicationId and at-least-once redelivery).
