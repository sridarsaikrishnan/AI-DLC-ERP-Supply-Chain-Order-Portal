"""Fact publishing for plain-CRUD domains (catalog, connections, tenancy) — distinct from
event sourcing. Per ADR-0002, these domains' rows are the source of truth, not an event
log; nothing here replays or reconstructs state from facts. This exists so other domains
can react to a change (a connection paused, an item's price changed) without polling or a
direct synchronous call into these modules — reusing the exact same transport Order's own
events already use (outbox -> SNS FIFO -> SQS, or the in-memory bus locally). No new
infrastructure: `platform-domain-events.fifo` already carries every event type; a new
event type just means no queue's filter policy matches it yet, until one is added.

ponytail: `OutboxFactPublisher.publish` commits in its own transaction, separate from the
repository write that triggered it — not the same transaction as `PostgresEventStore`'s
event+outbox write. A crash in that split-second window drops the fact, not the data.
Acceptable today because nothing consumes these facts yet (zero observable impact);
upgrade to a shared-session write if a future consumer makes this load-bearing.
